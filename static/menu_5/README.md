# A More Accessible Multi-Level Dropdown Navigation

My attempt at creating a more accessible multi-level dropdown navigation menu, which responds to the follow user interactions at any screen size -

- **Clicking** on the element with a mouse
- **Tapping** on the element on a touchscreen
- **Tabbing** into and out of the element with a keyboard

Although I started this myself, I received a lot of valuable input from people in the comments section of the blog post and have updated the final menu. [Check out the comments](http://bitsofco.de/2015/accessible-multi-level-dropdown-navigation/#disqus_thread)
